# Android Coding Challenge

üëã Hi there!

We're always looking for true talent, which is why we have designed the following task for you.

To see how you work in an existing codebase, and save you the trouble of writing too much boilerplate, we're giving you this app as a base for the challenge.

Blinkist is all about books! üìö Therefore the app displays a list of books to the user, based on data provided by a mocked API.

## Please add the following functionality:

- Add sections to the book list. Each section should represent a week
and contain all the books published within that week.
- Add some form of local persistence for the data received by the mocked API. The goal is to avoid
unnecessary API calls and add offline capabilities.

We will both look at your code and run the app, so please make sure that your code is clean and you provide a good user experience.

While solving this task, please make sure that all relevant parts of your code are **unit-tested**. You are welcome and encouraged to change any part of the provided code, but you should be able to explain any changes that you make, especially regarding the mock API. You are free to use external libraries and while we would love to see you write **Kotlin**, Java would be okay as well.

## Bonus points:

- Sticky headers in the book list;
- Allow the user to change the list to group the books alphabetically, where each section
represents a letter and contains all the books that start with that letter;
- Delightful UI experience;
- Reactive programming.

‚è∞ We value your time and therefore aimed to keep the challenge short. Nonetheless, this is an open-ended challenge, so feel free to take your time.

Please submit your solution as a **zip archive via email** within **one week** from receiving the challenge instructions. If you have any question or a suggestion for improvement, please let us know.

‚ö†Ô∏è To help us evaluate your task more fairly, we kindly ask you **not to** include your name in the challenge. We will, of course, consider your full profile once the task assessment is complete. This should ensure that our evaluations are as impartial as possible.

We're looking forward to receiving your solution. Good luck!
